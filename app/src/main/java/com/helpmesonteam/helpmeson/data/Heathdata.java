                "Difference between Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid arthritis\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Osteoarthritis is very common and generally occurs due to \"wear and tear\". The knees, hip, spine and hands bear the brunt of this type of arthritis. It is most often the elderly who are affected by it.Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, affects people across all age groups. It not only affects the joints, but also the lungs, eyes, skin, nerves and so on and can shorten the life span of a person.\n" +

                "By using modern techniques/methods, most of the arthritiss are treatable but not curable. Long term remissions, wherein an individual is symptom free for a prolonged period of time, is achievable. It can be kept under control with the usage of certain medicines, thus enabling the person to lead a near-normal life.\n" +

                "Constipation is one of the most troublesome disorders affecting the elderly. Senior citizens tend to be paranoid with regular/irregular bowel movements and at least 50% of them consume laxatives unnecessarily. It is said that their anxiety in relation to irregular bowel motions also causes headaches, exhaustion and loss of appetite.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Types of Constipation\n" +
                "There exist two types of constipation,\n" +
                "\n" +
                "An elderly person may pass stools daily, but it will be hard and sticky.\n" +
                "Stools may not be hard but bowel movements will be irregular.\n" +
                "Causes of constipation\n" +
                "Lack of adequate fibrous matter in the food consumed.\n" +
                "Intestinal cancer, hernia, piles and/or fissure in the anus, thyroid gland malfunctioning, excess calcium in the body, lack of potassium (hypokalemia) and mental depression.\n" +
                "The elderly tend to avoid drinking adequate quantities of water, due to the fear of urinating frequently (especially true of old women).\n" +
                "Drugs like iron tonics, painkillers, antacids, diuretics, anti-depressants, antihypertensive agents and sleeping tablets.\n" +
                "Lack of adequate exercise.\n" +
                "The elderly avoid visiting the toilet frequently because of unhygienic lavatory conditions.\n" +
                "Restricted mobility due to arthritis (in the hips and knees) or stroke.\n" +
                "Consequences\n" +
                "Chronic constipation leads to a complication that affects the overall health of individuals. Anxiety is uncalled for even if someone does not pass stools for a day or two. However, chronic constipation should be attended to immediately to avoid further complications.\n" +
                "Elderly people suffering from constipation may strain too much while defecating, which can result in chest pain. They may also experience a syncopal attack due to the transient reduction of blood supply to the brain.\n" +
                "Chronic constipation leads to prolonged intra-abdominal pressure due to straining, leading to hernia and varicose veins in the legs.\n" +
                "Hard and sticky stools may cause fissures in the anus and bleeding.\n" +
                "The distended rectum obstructs the urinary passage and causes retention of urine, particularly in those with an enlarged prostate.\n" +
                "Stagnation of stools in the large intestine may cause an obstruction, while the stagnating and impure water may leak out of the anus, causing spurious diarrhoea.\n" +
                "Taking laxatives for prolonged periods of time can be habit-forming and result in a dilated colon.\n" +
                "Irregular bowel movement can cause anxiety and stress.\n" +
                "Patients may become so obsessed about their so-called constipation, that they may take purgatives in large doses, resulting in diarrhea. Excess fluid and potassium losses can cause severe ill health, apathy and weakness.\n" +
                "Management\n" +
                "Treatment of primary causes\n" +
                "If a specific cause is identified, it should be corrected, for example, treating hypothyroidism, management of depression, correction of dehydration etc.\n" +
                "If medication is responsible for these issues, it must be stopped or the dosage may be reduced.\n" +
                "High fluid intake\n" +
                "A high fluid intake must be maintained.\n" +
                "An older person should consume at least 2-2.5 litres of fluids per day.\n" +
                "Regular exercise\n" +
                "Physical activity is encouraged. Daily exercises like walking is very essential in order to avoid constipation. Those who are bed ridden must do their exercises in the bed itself.\n" +
                "Abdominal massage has been proven to prevent constipation.\n" +
                "Pelvic floor exercises along with abdominal exercises are good methods of preventing constipation.\n" +
                "Intake of dietary fibre\n" +
                "The fibre content in the diet plays an important role in the prevention of constipation.\n" +
                "Many older persons select a diet that lacks adequate fibre content.\n" +
                "This, along with an inadequate fluid intake, can lead to persistent constipation and thus, the use of harmful laxatives and mineral oils.\n" +
                "Dietary fibres absorb and hold water, thus being valuable bulky agents as they increase the transit time in the gut.\n" +
                "The elderly should include 40 grams of dietary fibre per day in their diet.\n" +
                "Dietary fibre not only prevents constipation but also reduces the risk of cancer of the colon, reduces blood sugar and cholesterol levels as well as the incidence of gall stones.\n" +
                "High fluid intake is essential along with fibrous food. Fibre may interfere with the absorption and digestion of fat, protein and calcium. The benefits of including fibrous food in the diet are likely to outweigh any drawbacks.\n" +
                "Food items like millets, wheat, raagi, and rice bran are rich sources of fiber. To get relief from constipation, the patient should mix 2-4 spoonful’s of any fibre supplement either in milk or water and drink it.\n" +
                "There exists plenty of roughage in greens, plantain stem, cabbage, cauliflower, drumstick, bitter-gourd, dates, mangoes, figs, guava and wood apple.\n" +
                "It is believed that bananas are good for constipated patients but the quantity of roughage in bananas is insignificant. The starch present in bananas loosens and softens the stools.\n" +
                "There is plenty of fibrous matter in pepper, coriander, dried chillies, omurn, fenugreek and sundaikai (dry). Milk, sugar, fat, eggs, meat and fishes are devoid of soluble fibre.\n" +
                "Laxatives\n" +
                "Laxatives may be used as the last resort when the measures mentioned above fail.\n" +
                "There are different types of laxatives, as follows:\n" +
                "Lubricants and stool softeners (Liquid paraffin).\n" +
                "Bulking agents (Methyl cellulose and fibre supplements).\n" +
                "Osmotic agents (Sodium, potassium, magnesium salts and lactulose).\n" +
                "Chemicals (Senna, phenolphthalein and castor oil).\n" +
                "Prokinetics (Cisapride).\n" +
                "As a stool softener, liquid paraffin can be used. However, prolonged usage is not advisable as it may reduce the absorption of fat soluble vitamins and cause pulmonary aspiration. The surface acting agents like ‘Dulcolax’ allow penetration of water into the fecal matter as well as increase the transit through the intestine. This laxative should be used only when the fecal matter is hard.\n" +
                "Isapagol and other natural fibre supplements absorb water and increase the bulkiness of the motion. They must be taken with plenty of fluids and should not be taken by those who have difficulty in swallowing or have obstructive lesions of the small/large intestine.\n" +
                "Osmotic agents are useful for immediate evacuation of bowels, but long term management lubricants are said to be gentler. ‘Lactulose’ is fairly expensive and is taken as a sweet syrup.\n" +
                "Chemical laxatives like senna tend to stimulate the contractions of the colon through direct contact. Castor oil acts the quickest, though not suitable for regular use.\n" +
                "Enema\n" +
                "It refers to a procedure wherein a solution is injected into the rectum and the colon. The solution breaks up the fecal mass, stretches the rectal wall and initiates the defecation reflex.\n" +
                "An enema is used only if the above measures fail.\n" +
                "There are many types of enemas, the simplest being the cleaning enemas. They promote the complete evacuation of feces from the colon. The commonly used enema solutions are tap water, normal saline/hypertonic saline and soap water solution. However, water enemas often result in the irritation of the mucosa and are advised only for long standing constipation. The most commonly used enema is the glycerin enema. The advantage is that only small quantities are administered and it also softens the stools. This is ideal for the Geriatric age group.\n" +
                "Other enema solutions that are used include oil retention enemas, carminative enemas and medicated enemas. However, these are rarely used.\n" +
                "Prolonged use of enemas can cause rectal ulceration, bleeding and electrolyte imbalance. In old people who suffer from dehydration, the enemas should be administered carefully, since fluid loss may worsen the already existing dehydration. Hence, in the case of the above mentioned patients, it is better that a qualified personnel administers the enema.\n" +
                "Suppositories\n" +
                "Suppositories (enema pellets) are another alternative method to relieve constipation. This is well suited for bedridden patients and those with restricted mobility.\n" +
                "Since one cannot predict the time of bowel evacuation with laxatives, suppositories are ideal where one can get the desired response within ½ hours of insertion of the suppositories.\n" +
                "The hazardous effect of suppositories is the same as that of an enema.\n" +
                "Dos and Donts\n" +
                "Ensure adequate exercise.\n" +
                "Drink plenty of fluids.\n" +
                "Eat regularly and dont skip meals.\n" +
                "Start the day with a healthy breakfast.\n" +
                "Never hold back a bowel movement. As soon as you feel the urge, visit the loo. If possible, go around the same time each day, even if you do not feel the urge to visit the loo.\n" +
                "Chew your food thoroughly and eat slowly.\n" +
                "Never take a laxative unless prescribed by the doctor.\n" +
                "Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits.\n" ;

                "Twenty years after the first clinical evidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was reported, AIDS has become one of the most devastating diseases humankind has ever faced. While most of its victims are young adults, the pandemic has had major consequences for older people as well.\n" +
                "Elders in most societies are a vulnerable group, as a result of a lifetime of hardship, malnutrition, poverty and due to often chronic diseases.\n" +
                "The AIDS pandemic is now posing an additional burden on them, further increasing their vulnerability. In old age, when they may need support and expect to be looked after, many of them may have to take on the role of caring for others, in most cases without even the basic necessary resources.\n" +
                "Thus, their health is the most precious asset not only to them, but also to their families and communities. Lack of economic, social and psychological support combined with the inaccessibility of health services threatens their ability to provide the care expected from them.\n" +
                "All efforts must be made to support and address the vulnerability of these older persons, not the least because it is they who are rearing the future adult generation.\n" +
                "In the last 10 years, there has been a tenfold increase in the numbers of persons diagnosed at 65+ with AIDS.\n" +

                "Older Adults\n" +

                "Are more likely to be stigmatized and lack social support\n" +
                "Several factors are contributing to the increase in AIDS among the elderly which is pointed out briefly as follow:\n" +
                "RISK FACTORS\n" +
                "The dominant risk factor among the 50-and-over age group is the same as for other age groups, and that is heterosexual sex.\n" +
                "Specific risk behaviours, such as unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections and substance abuse are also present in this age group.\n" +
                "IMPLICATIONS OF AGE\n" +
                "According to the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), age accelerates the progress of HIV to AIDS and blunts CD4 cell response to antiretroviral therapy.\n" +
                "Age-related conditions, such as osteoporosis, increase the risk of severe complications. Intravenous infection is also a problem among seniors, partly because of aging baby boomers still doing drugs, but also because of diabetics sharing insulin needles.\n" +
                "UNPROTECTED SEX\n" +
                "Elders tend to view condoms primarily as a contraceptive measure, and women who no longer fear unwanted pregnancy may not insist on their use. Women also undergo physical changes with age that affect their vulnerability to HIV. In the post-menopausal stage, their vaginal walls are thinner and lubrication is often reduced. Many doctors believe older women are more vulnerable to vaginal trauma during intercourse, and are thus at greater risk of contracting HIV. Women after menopause are not going to use condoms because theyre not afraid of getting pregnant anymore, that’s why older women appear to have a higher incidence than older men.\n" +
                "DELAY IN DIAGNOSIS\n" +
                "Early symptoms of HIV infection:\n" +
                "Fatigue\n" +
                "poor memory\n" +
                "shortness of breath\n" +
                "sleeplessness\n" +
                "weight loss\n" +
                "Many of these symptoms may be mistaken for signs of ageing, thus preventing those infected from seeking early medical help that could help them stay healthy and prevent them from transmitting the disease to others.\n" +
                "PREVENTION\n" +
                "Health providers often fall into the trap of age stereotypes, which can be a problem in prevention and diagnosis.\n" +
                "Health care workers are less likely to ask older patients about their sexual behaviour and do not provide the prevention information they would routinely offer younger patients. Nor do prevention education programmes target elders.\n" +
                "Perhaps due to an increasing denial of sexual needs, social barriers to discussions on sexuality become even stronger with age - with the consequence that there are few effective strategies for this population group.\n" +
                "Elders must wrestle with issues not faced by the young person. They find themselves adjusting to the physical and emotional changes associated with ageing in the setting of a debilitating illness.\n" +
                "In addition, coping mechanisms among elders are weaker, and they are more prone to depression and less inclined to join support groups.\n" +
                "A number of strategies and behaviors can help mitigate the risk of HIV for elders and lessen the impact of HIV/AIDS on those already infected.\n" +
                "STRATEGIES AND BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ELDER AFFECTED BY HIV/AIDS\n" +

                "Reduce the double stigma (AIDS-related and ageism) and other prejudices among health care workers - particularly through training and education\n" +
                "Develop policies and initiatives to strengthen the capacity of older caregivers - such as economic support in the form of subsidies and education\n" +
                "Provide additional resources for the caregiver, including housing, medical care and food.\n" +
                "Reduce the stigma surrounding the sexual needs of elders and encourage them to discuss these issues with their health providers and families\n" +
                "Educate healthcare providers about the sexuality and sexual practices of elders to allow for improved communication and more accurate risk assessment\n" +
                "Integrate HIV programming into services for elders, including secondary prevention education (prevention among HIV-positive people), into specialized care services\n" +
                "Educate HIV service providers on the need to provide age-sensitive services and the specific issues related to HIV in an ageing population;\n" +
                "Identify areas of research specifically looking into the interactions between age and HIV\n" +
                "Involve elders in research on prevention and care.\n" +
                "Another major issue of concern to this population, which need actual attention is the elders playing role as care providers for chronically ill and terminally ill patients and the upkeep of children orphaned by AIDS\n" +

                "People over 50 years of age are much less likely to adopt HIV prevention strategies than are younger people who engage in the same behavioural risks.\n" +
                "HIV and AIDS are seldom discussed within this community.\n" +
                "Older Americans are not suspected of drug use.\n" +
                "Many are sexually active, often demonstrating risky sexual behaviors, not using protection, using IV drugs, and sharing needles, which places them at high risk for transmission of HIV\n" +
                "Evidence points to many infected elders contracting the disease through same-gender sexual contact.\n" +
                "In addition, elders are often finding themselves dating again due to being widowed or divorced and are engaging in sexual activity without protection.\n" +
                "Prevention, counselling, testing and education efforts are not being directed their way, and this problem needs to be addressed in the health care profession.\n" +

                "Consider HIV/AIDS as a possible cause of clinical disease and symptoms such as fatigue, altered mental status, rashes, chronic pain, and weight loss.\n" +
                "EDUCATE OLDER ADULTS\n" +
                "Elderly often depend upon primary care providers for health information. Healthcare providers must talk to their elderly patients about their risk and to educate them to prevent infection.\n" +
                "Where is your patient getting information about HIV/AIDS if not from you?\n" +
                "Patients have reported that their physicians dont ask\n" +
