    public ActiveAgeing() {
        active[0] = "According to projections made by the UN Population Division, there will be approximately two elderly persons for every child in the world by the year 2050.\n" +
                "This implies that the aged 60 and above, which currently constitute less than 20% of the population will account for 32% of the population by 2050.\n" +
                "Today, the biggest enemies of the geriatric population include solitude, loneliness, isolation, neglect and a sense of not being wanted.\n" +
                "Our society has traditionally treated the care of the elderly as the responsibility of the younger generation.\n" +
                "However, the rapid increase in the number of nuclear families, the growing urbanization and the global nature of employment opportunities are forcing a change in this implicit social contract.\n" +
                "THE CONCEPT OF LONELINESS\n" +
                "Loneliness and the state of being alone are different entities.\n" +
                "Aloneness is simply being physically away from others. Loneliness, on the other hand, can be defined as a chronic, distressful mental state whereby an individual feels estranged from/rejected by peers and is starved for the emotional intimacy found in relationships and mutual activity.\n" +
                "Loneliness doesnt refer to depression or grief. Though depression may result from loneliness, the two are not synonymous. A lonely individual is driven to establish new relationships to eradicate the distressful state he/she endures. A depressed individual, on the other hand, is unwilling to impose his/her unhappiness on others and therefore remains in isolation.\n" +
                "Loneliness also differs from grief. Though loneliness could result from the death of a spouse or the end of some significant relationship that may have comprised the bulk of an individuals social interaction, it is not the same as grief. Grief is the process of coming to terms with the loss of a loved one, while loneliness is simply a component of this procedure responding to the absence of the loved one.\n" +
                "Loneliness is not the self-imposed. Though many artists (of various vocations) seek voluntary solitude as a means to get inspired and focus on a project, constructive aloneness is not tantamount to a state of loneliness. In fact, when adolescents were tested for loneliness and creativity to determine if this correlation existed, an inverse relationship was found.\n" +
                "It should be noted that loneliness is also not the self-imposed isolation sought for spiritual purposes.\n" +
                "Taoists speak of a state known as returning, which is the centering of the self after having been involved in the days social activities. Returning comprises of isolation from others to cleanse oneself of their influences. The same is true of monks and nuns of many religions who live a cloistered existence, sometimes abandoning speech or other forms of human interaction as a means to achieve greater enlightenment on spiritual matters.\n" +
                "Again, this is a form of solitude that is chosen, and is designed to achieve a specific goal. It does not accurately reflect the distressful, unwanted state of loneliness.\n" +
                "CATEGORIES OF LONELINESS\n" +
                "Loneliness can be divided into two categories with separate symptomology and differing courses of treatment:\n" +
                "Emotional Isolation – This is brought about by the loss of a significant relationship in ones life through death/divorce.\n" +
                "The only means by which this loneliness can be remedied is by finding another equally important relationship to fill the void, and not just by becoming socially active in a superficial, non-intimate manner.\n" +
                "This type of loneliness is often accompanied by hyper-alertness and anxiety, making the individual oversensitive to social cues, leading them to misinterpret or exaggerate the intentions of others (whether positive or negative).\n" +
                "Emotional isolation is compared to the fearful abandonment feelings of childhood. Attachment styles learned in childhood, as a means of relating to a caregiver are repeated through adulthood as one bond in other significant relationships. Therefore an individual who achieves a secure attachment style with a caregiver in childhood is less likely to experience loneliness as an adult, due to the fact that they have developed trust and social skills that facilitate interpersonal relationships.\n" +
                "Emotional isolation has also been termed as the loneliness of early detachment experiences and at times, has even been referred to as primary loneliness, in order to differentiate it from other temporary types of loneliness.\n" +
                "Social Isolation – This involves the deficiency of a social network.\n" +
                "The feelings in this form of loneliness revolve around boredom, a lack of focus and a sense of being marginalized/rejected by peers. Once this individual has access to a network of social interaction, the symptoms usually dissipate. Six key relationships have been identified, and a deficit in any one of these can cause social loneliness.\n" +
                "The first is termed as attachments, which refers to associations in which one feels a sense of safety and security, such as with a spouse or parent/s.\n" +
                "The seconds is termed as social integration refers to the existence of a network of relationships, generally provided in a group setting such as a neighborhood, church or club.\n" +
                "The third is termed as opportunity for nurturance and refers to all associations that involve the individual acting as a caregiver or simply being responsible for anothers well-being in some fashion.\n" +
                "The fourth is termed reassurance of worth and refers to relationships that highlight/acknowledge a persons skills and abilities, such as in a work setting.\n" +
                "The fifth is termed as reliable alliances and refers to having support and others to count on.\n" +
                "The sixth and final is termed as guidance and refers to the comparative advantage of having people in your life whom you can trust, and can seek advice from. The absence of any of these associations could bring about social loneliness as the many facets of an individuals social needs are not being met.\n" +
                "LONELINESS AND ELDERLY\n" +
                "The elderly tend to face the issue of loneliness the most. One may lose a spouse through death or divorce. Friendships cease due to death or retirement relocation. Children leave the nest for college or to begin their own lives, perhaps in other cities, and focus their energy away from the nuclear family.\n" +
                "Moreover, due to failing health or the inability to drive or walk, an older person may become housebound.\n" +
                "More revealing, however, is the locus of control attribution in the aged. Those who internalize the responsibility and control of their own lives were found to be less lonely than those who felt they had little control over the latter part of their lives.\n" +
                "STRATEGIES TO COMBAT LONELINESS\n" +
                "Keep busy: If you are lonely, do with eagerness whatever is in front of you to do: for example, write letters, visit people, fix something that needs to be fixed, take up a hobby, start collecting something of value and so on. The cure to loneliness is keeping busy.\n" +
                "Involve yourself more: If you are lonely, involve yourself in community affairs. In many cases, when people retire, they find themselves in a burned-out condition, thus resulting in them leading a sedentary lifestyle. This kind of mental attitude sets a person up to be lonely.\n" +
                "Help others: If you are lonely, look for and strive to cure the loneliness of someone else. In the process, you will also manage to cure your own loneliness\n" +
                "Avoid escaping from reality by day dreaming, sleeping too much and watching too much television. The television can be a life-saver at times, but excessive television-watching is a sure-shot way of becoming depressed and lonely. Too much sleep can be a powerful escape mechanism from guilt, responsibility, failure, and hopelessness. Fight the tendency to sleep too much.\n" +
                "Choose to be happy: If you are lonely, you are probably depressed and unhappy. Choose to be happy in spite of the circumstances. For example, Asking yourself questions like, \"How does my unhappiness change my situation?\" will make you realize that it doesnt, and that it just makes it worse. So make things better for yourself by choosing to be happy. Fight depression by talking out your problems. Talk to friends, relatives or a counselor, and keep talking until you find yourself maintaining an attitude of optimism.\n" +
                "Collect good thoughts: If you are lonely, collect inspirational thoughts, good jokes, meaningful poems, and literary masterpieces. Read as many books as you can. Make a list of good things that you read about and then try to memorize some inspirational quotation and share it with whoever comes your way. Collect good thoughts to share with those people who come your way, and soon others will seek your company.\n" +
                "Join a social group: If you are lonely, join one of the many social groups in your community. See that you visit the Senior Citizens Club regularly and meet new people. Commit yourself to one or more groups that interest you.";
        active[1] = "Ageing is a slow process that every individual goes through.\n" +
                "It is a process that projects visible changes. Some of these changes include greying hair, wrinkling of the skin as well as internal physiological changes\n" +
                "The process varies widely from individual to individual.\n" +

                "As people age, they become susceptible to a multitude of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, urinary disorders, osteo-arthritis, cardiovascular disorders, depression, dementia etc.\n" +
                "Those elderly, who are relatively well-off, tend to consume multiple drugs on a regular basis and since these drugs are available over the counter in the market, they consume more of these said drugs\n" +
                "It should be noted that consulting a doctor is a must before consuming any form of medication.\n" +
                "Dangers related to clinical disorders\n" +
                "There always exists the likelihood that diseases affecting the elderly are ignored because they are assumed to be the ‘routine manifestations’ of old age and in such cases, it is assumed that consulting a doctor isn’t needed\n" +
                "As a result, by the time the doctor is consulted, the disease has already advanced significantly.\n" +
                "Physiological decline and consequences\n" +
                "Atrophy of the taste buds and loss of teeth\n" +
                "Changes in the gastro-intestinal tract\n" +

                "Always consult a doctor if unwell. Do not self-medicate";
        active[2] = "There is no way to avoid the realization that one’s body is not what it used to be. With age, the overall tone of the body begins to sag and innumerable inner parts call attention to themselves through their mal-function.\n" +
                "Some problems may be fairly petty, like the almost inevitable appearance of wrinkles. Others are painful, debilitating, and cause a sense of shame (e.g. incontinence).\n" +
                "An important aspect of preventing health problems in older adults and improving their health is to encourage individuals to exercise more and to develop better nutritional habits.\n" +
                "The older adults are healthier and happier when they are active.\n" +
                "Physical exercise is becoming a focus of leisure activity for more and older adults, as its benefits are linked to health, self-esteem, and zest for life.\n" +
                "Recent studies suggest a relationship between physical fitness, and the improvement of certain visuo-spatial cognitive abilities that typically decline with age.\n" +
                "Exercise leads to improvements in various central nervous system functions. The benefits of exercise are attributed to higher levels of oxygen, which improve the metabolism of glucose and neurotransmitters in the brain, as well as to increased levels of arousal, which increase response speed.\n" +
                "For many old adults, the absence of meaningful interpersonal relationships is the greatest barrier to optimal functioning. The role of the informal social support system cannot be underestimated in meeting the needs of the elderly.\n" +
                "In summary, the quality of life of the elderly depends on three factors:\n" +
                "The specific nature and timing of the health-related limitations that accompany aging.\n" +
                "The availability of appropriate resources within the home, family, and community to help compensate for or minimize those limitations; and\n" +
                "The selective emphasis that the person gives to some life experiences over others as being central to well-being.\n" +
                "YOGA, LAUGHTER CLUB AND ITS BENEFITS FOR ELDERS\n" +
                "The prime objective of a laughter club is to function as a stress buster especially for all psychosomatic disorders.\n" +
                "Since, most of the members are elderly citizens, they are at an age when their stress level and their sense of insecurity soars, while their physical flexibility and potential deteriorates.\n" +
                "In order to meet the requirements of the elderly, simple yoga should be practiced, which focus on the heart, lungs and the digestive system.\n" +
                "And above all, practice many happy bouts of laughter!\n" +
                "BENEFITS\n" +
                "Laughter Club members express appreciation for their club through their feelings of ‘being in good health’ and also reflected in their faces and in their speech.\n" +
                "All members agree that the interpersonal bonding through the laughter club is the best thing to have happened to them post retirement.\n" +

                "Eating the right type of food is important for a healthy lifestyle.\n" +
                "As people age, they are susceptible to a multitude of diseases/conditions.\n" +
                "Many of these diseases/conditions like hypertension, diabetes and obesity can be prevented or at least modified by consuming a balanced diet.\n" +
                "Nutrition has emerged as a major modifiable determinant of chronic diseases and age related decline.\n" +
                "Some of the dietary changes that emerge as people age are as follows:\n" +
                "The nutritional needs of the elderly are very different. As people age, their activity levels decline and the body’s metabolism slows down, thus requiring lesser energy as well as smaller quantities of food.\n" +
                "Even though the elderly need less energy, they need the same amount or even more of vitamins and minerals. Food items rich in Vitamins E and C are known to have anti-ageing benefits as well as protective benefits from diseases like cancer, heart diseases and cancer.\n" +
                "Loss of teeth with advancing age leads to severe issues. As a result of this, chewing becomes extremely tough. Hence, the elderly prefer liquids or mashed food, though these may be deficient in terms of nourishment and supplements.\n" +
                "As people age, their power to digest and absorb food gradually diminishes. Hence, certain modifications in the kind and amount of food consumed become necessary.\n" +
