                "HOW TO REPORT IT\n" +
                "Ideally the problem of Elder Abuse has to be approached holistically.

                "Counseling\n" +
                "Vulnerable adults or victims can be counseled to assess their options for safety and to resolve conflicts in family. Counseling will also help the abused overcome the trauma. Group or individual counseling may be used. Main objectives of such intervention would be: to educate victims about resources and options; break through denial and shame; make plans to avoid future abuse (safety planning); build support networks; and manage post-traumatic stress. Family counseling is useful to resolve or mediate conflicts and tensions in the family that give rise to neglect or abuse.\n" +
                "Legal Assistance\n" +
                "Subsidized or free legal aid should be available for victims. Legal help may be needed to recover property or assets, to restrain the abuser or restrict contact between perpetrators and victims, for guardianship issues (when the elder is not capable of taking care of self) and for prosecuting the offenders.\n" +
                "Respite care and Support services\n" +
                "Respite care programs at home, adult care and at institutions is vital to support families and carers. Caregiver stress may be reduced by providing services in the community that reduce burden and provide relief. Managing the finance of elders to avoid frauds, support groups for care givers, respite programs, home delivered meal programs for elders living alone, adult day-care services and friendly visitors to homes of isolated seniors, routine telephone ‘check-in’ programs to reassure lonely elders, are other support services.\n" +
                "Violence Prevention programs\n" +
                "Domestic violence programs may be extended to cover seniors also. Services such as crisis lines, shelters for abused, support and counseling services in safe homes would be required for abused elders also.\n" +
                "Interventions for Abusers\n" +
                "A range of physical, rehabilitative, behavioral and legal measures should be available to prevent abuser from repeating violent behavior.\n" +
                "Sensitizing Public and Advocacy for Elders\n" +
                "NGOs, voluntary groups, charitable trusts and Senior Citizens Associations can create awareness.\n" +
                "HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP\n" +
                "There are various ways you can help prevent abuse in your neighborhood. All it takes is a little initiative and the will to help those who are vulnerable.\n" +
                "Empowering elders in your area through awareness campaigns, informing them of the utility of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act (2007)\n" +
                "Provide elders with the local Police Station number which they can call in times of emergencies\n" +
                "Give more power & provide Guidelines to local Police to take action against Elder Abuse\n" +
                "Help in establishing Counseling Centers or use the existing Community centres for providing legal, financial, psycho – social help to elders.\n" +
                "Form a Senior Citizens Forum in the community which can act as a powerful agency in cases of detection, prevention and amelioration of domestic abuse\n" +
